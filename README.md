# Weather Demo App

    This is an iOS app that displays the Current Weather and 5 Day Forecast. The app is written in Swift, making use of Core Location and the built-in functionalities of SwiftUI.

## Project Description 

This shows the weather for the Current Location of your device using the OpenWeatherAPI (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/)

## Table of Contents

In the structure files contains: Model, View, Manager


# Installation
Can be used with Xcode 14 and above. Compatible with iPhone and iPad with minimum iOS version 15.0.

# Framework
SwiftUI
CoreLocation
 

# Architecture
This application uses MVP for simplicity.

# How to Run
On launch, my application opens to a View that allows you to share your location with the app, then loads into a view that shows the weather for your current location.

# Design Decisions
I decided to use colors that remind you of the sky as well as colors that match the icons that are being pulled from the OpenWeatherAPI. For animations I decided to go with choices that felt intuitive to the design of the view.

# Challenges
 Due to time constraits I wasn't able to complete all of the Bonus Objectives but all required functionality has been implemented.
