# WeatherApp

How to Run:
On launch, my application opens to a View that allows you to share your location with the app, then loads into a view that shows the weather for your current location. 

Design Decisions:
I decided to use colors that remind you of the sky as well as colors that match the icons that are being pulled from the OpenWeatherAPI.
For animations I decided to go with choices that felt intuitive to the design of the view.

Challenges:
Due to time constraits I wasn't able to complete all of the Bonus Objectives but all required functionality has been implemented.
